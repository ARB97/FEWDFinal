        <h1>Comfort in Crisis</h1>
        <p> Social contact affects mental and physical health. The 2020 pandemic caused us to be homebound, alone, and
            in uncertain times.
            Our recent experiences of being physically forced apart and shut in, is how many elderly
            people felt even before the restrictions of COVID-19. Can you imagine how they feel now?</p>

        <br> <br>

        <h2>The mission</h2>
        <p> We have to stay connected and build genuine friendships with the people in
            our communities. Reach out to those
            who are shut in. Identify who needs help, or companionship, or comfort. Assist them to the
            best of our abilities.
        </p>


        <br> <br>


        <h2>Why we do it</h2>
        <p>
            The most vulnerable among us are the ones who paved the way for us. We can never forget that. During this
            pandemic, there are
            grave risks to
            physical isolation. With stay at home orders
            going on almost a year, the older generation is at risk for depression, and heart ailments, and lonliness.
            They deserve our time and effort
            to be
            there for their needs.

        </p>
