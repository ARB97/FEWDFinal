            <h2>Why we do it</h2>
            <p>
                The most vulnerable among us are the ones who paved the way for us. We can never forget that. During
                this pandemic, there are grave risks to
                physical isolation. With stay at home orders
                going on almost a year, the older generation is at risk for depression, and heart ailments, and
                loneliness.
                They deserve our time and effort to be
                there for their needs.

            </p>

            <h2>Comfort in Crisis</h2>
            <p> Social contact impacts our mental and physical health. The 2020 pandemic left us homebound, and in a
                way,
                left some helpless. While we have been physically forced apart and shut in, this is how many elderly
                people felt even before the restrictions of COVID-19. Can you imagine how they feel now?</p>

            <br>

            <h2>The mission</h2>
            <p> We have to stay connected and build genuine friendships with the people in
                our communities. Reach out to those
                who are shut in. Identify who needs help, or companionship, or comfort. Assist them to the
                best of our abilities.
            </p>
